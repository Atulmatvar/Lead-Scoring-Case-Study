# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Logistic regression model

Problem Statement :
X Education is an online education company that offers courses to industry professionals. They market their courses on various websites and search engines, and many interested professionals visit their website on any given day. However, despite acquiring a lot of leads, their lead conversion rate is poor, with only around 30% of leads getting converted.

To make the lead conversion process more efficient, the company wants to identify the most potential leads, also known as "Hot Leads". By focusing on communicating with these potential leads rather than everyone, the lead conversion rate should increase. The company has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads and build a model to assign a lead score to each lead, with a higher score indicating a higher likelihood of conversion.

We have been provided with a dataset of around 9000 leads, consisting of various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. The target variable is the column 'Converted', which indicates whether a lead was converted or not (1 for converted, 0 for not converted).

Our goal is to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
